# SixtCars

Simple app for show car on map

#  Libraries:

# Retrofit

I used reofit for call api beacause it makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload data via a REST based webservice.In Retrofit you configure which converter is used for the data serialization. Typically for JSON you use GSon, but you can add custom converters to process XML or other protocols. Retrofit uses the OkHttp library for HTTP requests.

# Coroutine

I used coroutine for concurrency and execute api asynchronously. coroutines help to manage long-running tasks that might otherwise block the main thread and cause your app to become unresponsive.

# Dagger2

I used dagger2 for dependency injection, it helps to automate dependency injection in the app. With Dagger, you don't have to write tedious and error-prone boilerplate code.

# LifeCycle

For handle lifecycle changes of viewmodels we should use LifeCycle androidx lib. These components help you produce better-organized, and often lighter-weight code, that is easier to maintain.

# Google map

I used google map for show cars on map

# Glide

The best library for download and show images.
